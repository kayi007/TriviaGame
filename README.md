 # Overview
 
A Disney trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option and display a gif taken from GIPHY API. After a few seconds, it will display the next question.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

If the player runs out of time, it will tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

If the player chooses the wrong answer, it will tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

Once play finishes all the questions, on the final screen, it will show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

Inserted Disney Entrance Music in the background while players are playing the game.
